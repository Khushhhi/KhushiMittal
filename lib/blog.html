                Week 1 at Stanford has been amazing so far. Met new people, fountain hoped (stanny’s tradition where you jump into water fountains on campus), got tanned in the california 
                sun and pushed myself to keep dreaming big. If you’re ever planning to be here, I 100% recommend taking ME 344 with Steve Jones. We are learning to assemble and install a 
                computer node from scratch :))

                Looking back into Stanford’s history, the founders - Jane and Leeland Stanford wanted to build something that would help humanity move forward. An institution for learning, 
                a place to bring people together. I let history inspire me as I try to instill the same values into LifeWire. I’ve heard a lot of people telling me how this is the dotcom era 
                for AI and how this is both the best and the worst time to build a company in AI. This makes me think about the trends of human rat race alot. From a non-pessimestic perspective, 
                it’s fascinating how we like to absolutely dive deep into a field until it saturates and the “bubble” bursts. Future is highly undeterministic and I strongly believe in pursuing 
                what excites us in the moment (ofc be responsible about it).
                We have received primary feedback from more than 70 potential users and secondary feedback from more than 120. We have 15 people signed up for our closed beta launch on August 1st.

                We spent hours thinking about features that can help people find out their true ambition. Guess what? It doesn’t work that way. Ambition can be really personal and changes with every 
                individual. What we can do instead is to provide them with a platform that helps them get started and try new things.

                Yeah I know, I clearly love this speech so much. I want people to be as concerned about being happy doing what they do as they are about looking for their perfect partner. 
                Life’s too short to not do something epic.

            <p>Last month has been crazy - finished my first year of university with average grades and above-average
                life plans. Travelled all the way back to India only to die from the heat (ate some amazing food that instantly made
                me sick. Worth it.).

                It's fascinating what AI's been doing to the world lately. I wonder if people felt the same way when Apple introduced 
                the iMac and Google introduced their first search engine. I am sure Gordon Moore had an "aha" moment after seeing the ambition 
                during the 70s and covered it with his transistors mummbo jumbo to come up with Moore's law. Every day I wake up to someone building
                something cool on the internet and it genuinely excites me to see how much potential people have. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Ok enough with the emotional outburst.

                Life update - I met Dominic Zlat, an 18-year-old high school student and self-taught full stack developer from Romania through Y Combinator's
                co-founder matching program (I clearly love to tell this story lol.) I don't think I've ever emphasized this enough but I love YC so much. I think they are doing
                some really cool stuff out there. 

                So, Dominic and I instantly started talking about how it's 2023 and people are still stuck in their boring jobs and are unable to figure out what they truly wish to
                do in life. We instantly came up with this solution - why don't we let people try out different career paths before choosing the right one for themselves? Rest was history. 
            </p>   

            <p>
                With shine in our eyes and strong black coffee in our cups, we started building our dream project - LifeWire (no we are not the tech news platform :3) We desperately wanted 
                feedback and hence, we started talking to people. Within a week, we realized that this wouldn't be as simple as we imagined it to be. Thankfully, we also very quickly realized 
                that it’s our monkey brain talking and started enjoying the thrill that’s coming with building a platform that’s not easy to make. I mean what’s a better way to learn than tinker 
                with hard problems, specially at a stage where we have no users or investors to disappoint?

                I am writing it all here so that I can come back to this one day and connect the dots. Because -
