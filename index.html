                        <p>Hi! I am Khushi Mittal. I am obsessed with things that fly. 
                            Anything to do with propulsion systems, aerodynamics, space technology, and mars--I'm in!

                            I love having conversations about how <b> the future is better than you think</b> and going on unnecessarily long walks. Growing up, I’ve lived in a bunch of different places 
                            and met <b>sooooo</b> many people. I carry a little piece of each of these places and people with me.  My <i>enlightenment</i> came at 
                            17 when I realized that math and physics aren’t as bad as they’re often taught in school. That’s when I became curious
                            about the world of technology and startups. 
                        <p>
                            I studied Computing Science major with a minor in Physics at University of Alberta (the home for reinforcement learning), 
                            where I helped make an <a href="https://uaarg.com/"> autonomous multi-rotor drone</a> for competitions across North America and worked on 
                            research projects involving reinforcement learning and genetic programming. I later attended a summer semester at Stanford University 
                            studying Symbolic Systems and high-performance computing. 
                        </p>
                       <p>
                        I dropped out of university and moved back to India in January, 2024.
